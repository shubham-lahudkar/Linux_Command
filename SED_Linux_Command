SED command in UNIX stands for stream editor and it can perform lots of functions on file like searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion.
which is much quicker way to find and replace something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.
Replacing or substituting string : Sed command is mostly used to replace the text in a file.          $sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
Replacing the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line : Use the /1, /2 etc flags to replace the first, second occurrence of a pattern in a line.     $sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt
Replacing all the occurrence of the pattern in a line : The substitute flag /g (global replacement) specifies the sed command to replace all the occurrences of the string in the line.  $sed 's/unix/linux/g' geekfile.txt
Replacing from nth occurrence to all occurrences in a line : Use the combination of /1, /2 etc and /g to replace all the patterns from the nth occurrence of a pattern in a line    $sed 's/unix/linux/3g' geekfile.txt
Parenthesize first character of each word : This sed example prints the first character of every word in parenthesis.            $ echo "Welcome To The Geek Stuff" | sed 's/\(\b[A-Z]\)/\(\1\)/g'
Replacing string on a specific line number : You can restrict the sed command to replace the string on a specific line number.     $sed '3 s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
Duplicating the replaced line with /p flag : The /p print flag prints the replaced line twice on the terminal. If a line does not have the search pattern and is not replaced, then the /p prints that line only once.  $sed 's/unix/linux/p' geekfile.txt
Printing only the replaced lines : Use the -n option along with the /p print flag to display only the replaced lines         $sed -n 's/unix/linux/p' geekfile.txt
Replacing string on a range of lines : You can specify a range of line numbers to the sed command for replacing a string.    $sed '1,3 s/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt
Deleting lines from a particular file : SED command can also be used for deleting lines from a particular file. SED command is used for performing deletion operation without even opening the file   $ sed 'nd' filename.txt
